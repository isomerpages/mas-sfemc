##### FX Global Code - Statement of Commitment
The FX Global Code is a set of global principles of good practice in the foreign exchange market, developed to provide a common set of guidelines to promote the integrity and effective functioning of the wholesale FX market. It was developed by a partnership between central banks and market participants from 16 jurisdictions around the globe.

A key part of the FX Global Code is the Statement of Commitment. This is a single, common basis by which market participants can demonstrate their commitment to adhere to the FX Global Code.

For more information about the FX Global Code and the Statement of Commitment, please see the Global Foreign Exchange Committee website.
